# Time-Table-Automation-Project
Time Table Automation for IIITDWD.

As a student passionate about improving processes, I undertook the challenge of streamlining the scheduling process for IIITDWD students and faculty. 

My project in Time Table Automation aimed to generate optimized time tables for all sections, semesters, and branches within the university.  
Using my expertise in Python programming and data structures, I implemented a solution that efficiently manages university resources and optimizes their utilization. The application is user-friendly and generates the time table in mere milliseconds.  
I am proud to say that this project was successful in generating the time table for the courses offered by IIITDWD. 
It was a part of my 2nd semester data structures course, and it has made a tangible impact.  

The idea for this project is available in this GitHub repository in form of a ppt.
I hope that it can serve as a resource for other students passionate about improving processes.
